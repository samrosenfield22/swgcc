swgcc -- the swg c compiler

"syn-tax-trees. mash 'em, boil 'em, stick 'em in a stew" --me, maybe

right now this is set up as a c interpreter, so you can build w the makefile, run the executable ("swgcc -q" if you don't want all the pretty diagnostics i worked so hard on...), and enter c code that's hopefully supported by now.
oh what's that you ask? what IS supported? check out my pathetic excuse for a manual (manual.txt).
